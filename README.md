This is a website which allows you to look for movies and tv shows.
It is coded to practice CSS, HTML properities.
There are several pages for different purposes. Users can see whats popular, check subscription options, filter movies by their categories, read movie's description, see comments, ratings, etc.
Since there is no backend, it is all hardcoded for now.
